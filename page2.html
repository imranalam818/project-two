      <p>When 2020 COVID - 19 hit the USA in early March and forced everybody to stay at home, at that time while learning how the virus spread and what we can do to protect ourselves, I realized that it is a very good opportunity to do full-time something I always wanted to do, " Bird Watching in My Backyard."</p> 
      <p>The Bird Feeder we installed several years ago was serving the birds well and every day it is a delight to behold a variety of birds visiting our backyard. The regular visitors are:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>House Sparrow</li>
        <li>Mourning Dove</li>
        <li>House Finch and</li>
        <li>Grackle</li>
      </ul>
      <p>and occasional visitors include, </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Red-winged Blackbird and</li>
        <li>Northern Cardinal</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every day arranging seeds, water, and watching birds in the backyard gives us real pleasure, satisfaction and also helps in reducing stress and anxiety of COVID -19.</p>
